## Title Screen
The first screen of the game. It has a large logo saying 'Kirby's Dream Land' with star particles emerging on top of it. Along with that, we see Kirby doing sequenced moves at the bottom of the screen.

Pressing the 'A' key or the 'Start' key moves the player to [[TfSD SB - UI - Data Select|Data Select]], and pressing the 'B' key or the 'Escape' key closes the game.
