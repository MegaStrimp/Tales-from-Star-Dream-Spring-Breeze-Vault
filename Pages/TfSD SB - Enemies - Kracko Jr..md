**Points -** 7500

An eye surrounded by four small orbs. It floats around, dropping small, black spheres and creatingÂ [Waddle Doos](https://wikirby.com/wiki/Waddle_Doo "Waddle Doo"). The latter can be inhaled for ammunition.

In the Extra Game, it moves faster and in a different pattern, as well as dropping bombs, which are worth 20 points, instead of Waddle Doos.
