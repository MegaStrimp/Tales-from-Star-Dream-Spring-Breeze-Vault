### AI States
#### Mount
The enemy spawns a [[TfSD SB - Enemies - Poppy Bros. Jr.#Ride Apple|Poppy Bros. Jr. - Ride Apple]] and walks back and forth without friction. If the spawned enemy doesn't exist, the enemy does some jumps and switches to [[TfSD SB - Enemies - Apple#Stand|Stand]]. Can't get inhaled.
#### Stand
The enemy stands still on ground.
#### Bounce
The enemy falls down and if it hits ground, it switches direction relative to the player's and starts bouncing to that direction. The bounces get less height over time.
