## HUD
![[TfSD SB - Image - UI - HUD.png]]
A UI element where the player can see some of the important stats of the playable character. These consist of player HP, lives, score and the character's name.

Along with that, when a [[TfSD SB - Enemy Categories - Boss|boss]] is on the screen, the score counter gets replaced by a Boss HP counter, and a boss icon is added next to it.
