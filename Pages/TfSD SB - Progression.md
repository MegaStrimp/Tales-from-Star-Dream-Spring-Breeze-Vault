## Progression
Kirby's Dream Land is a two-dimensional platforming game set in the whimsical fantasy realm of Dream Land. The player controls Kirby and must successfully complete each stage by getting this spry round fellow to the end - avoiding attacks from enemies before losing all of his vitality points to them - and defeating the boss at the end of each stage. To accomplish this, Kirby has a fair amount of abilities at his disposal; able to walk, fly, and let out an Air Bullet or use a Dive Attack to defeat nearby opponents. Kirby can also use his signature inhale to dispose of enemies and objects, though he cannot fly while something is in his mouth.

By inhaling an enemy or object, Kirby can either spit them back out as a Star Bullet to defeat other enemies and destroy obstacles, or Kirby can swallow the inhaled object to remove it from the equation. However, when swallowing an enemy, Kirby does not gain any new ability, as his trademark Copy Ability would not be part of his toolkit until the next game: Kirby's Adventure. Kirby's Dream Land also features a score tally, which increases by defeating enemies, or even just breaking Star Blocks. Like many other video games, the score has no direct effect on the gameplay, nor is it saved in any sort of high-score table.
