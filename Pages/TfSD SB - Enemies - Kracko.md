**HP -** 6
**Points -** 25000

An adult form of [[TfSD SB - Enemies - Kracko Jr.|Kracko Jr.]], this spiky cloud floats through the room or swoops at Kirby, stopping at the sides of the area to fire beams all around itself and create [[TfSD SB - Enemies - Waddle Doo|Waddle Doos]]. The latter has to be inhaled and spat back at it to beat it.  
Its attack pattern changes drastically in the [[TfSD SB - Gamemodes - Extra Game|Extra Game]]; here, it can either charge along the ground, fire beams from the center of the screen, or move along the top, dropping bombs that are worth 20 points and can be spat back.
