Lalala appears from one of four doors at the right side of the screen, pushing chests that are worth 400 points across platforms and kicking them at the player. She can be defeated by inhaling the boxes and spitting them back.

In the Extra Game, she walks faster and may bring outÂ [Gordos](https://wikirby.com/wiki/Gordo "Gordo").
