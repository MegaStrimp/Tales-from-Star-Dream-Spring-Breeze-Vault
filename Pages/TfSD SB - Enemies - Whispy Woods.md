**HP -** 6
**Points -** 10000

This large tree does not move, but blows puffs of air at the player as well as dropping apples from his leaves, which are worth 400 points and can be spat back at him. Unlike in a handful of later games featuring the boss, getting close to Whispy does not harm the player.  
In the Extra Game, Whispy Woods drops [Gordos](https://wikirby.com/wiki/Gordo "Gordo") in addition to apples, which bounce along the ground until moving off the screen.
