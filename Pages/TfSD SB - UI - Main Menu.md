## Main Menu
![[Images/TfSD SB - Image - UI - Main Menu.png]]
A scrollable menu where the player can select a gamemode or menu, using the Up/Down keys, if the selection is unlocked.

The selections are handled via a 'ds_list' where the menu buttons are added to the list if they're deemed 'unlocked' in the save file. To unlock everything, the player can pressÂ 'up', 'select', and 'A' buttons while on the title screen.

Pressing the 'A' key or the 'Start' key moves the player to the target of their selection, and pressing the 'B' key moves the player back to [[TfSD SB - UI - Data Select|Data Select]].
