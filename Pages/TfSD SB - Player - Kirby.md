## Kirby

Kirby is the starting character of the game. He inhales to swallow enemies and can float like a balloon.
### Moveset
#### *Walk -* Left/Right
Kirby moves at a modest pace in a given direction.
#### *Jump -* A
Kirby jumps from the ground, which can vary in height depending on how long the player holds the button down. Kirby can also maneuver in midair while jumping.
#### *Float -* A while midair
While in the air, Kirby takes in air, and holds his breath, allowing him to fly by flapping his arms. This method of flight is slow and leaves Kirby vulnerable, but it gets the job done.
#### *Air Bullet -* B while Floating
While hovering, Kirby can release his taken-in air to come back down, which will fly forward a short distance and damage enemies.
#### *Crouch -* Down
Kirby crouches, taking up less space on the ground, allowing him to dodge some attacks from enemies. Doing this is also necessary to drop through platforms.
#### *Inhale -* B
Kirby opens his mouth wide and starts sucking in air at a continuous rate. Nearby enemies and objects will fly into his mouth. Not every object can be inhaled.
#### *Carry -* Inhale an object
Kirby gets in an inflated state while carrying the objects he has inhaled. Can walk around and jump as usual.
#### *Star Bullet -* B while Carrying
After inhaling something, Kirby can spit it back out as a Star Bullet, which will fly forward at very high speed and damage any enemy it hits. Multiple objects inhaled will be spat out as a Blaster Bullet, which is even stronger, and passes through enemies, allowing it to damage multiple before it shatters after hitting a wall of some sort.
#### *Swallow -* B while Carrying
After inhaling something, Kirby can swallow the object, removing it from the game.
#### *Swim -* In water
(STRIMPTODO)
#### *Dive Attack -* Keep falling midair
After falling for long enough, Kirby dives headlong and can damage enemies he falls onto.
