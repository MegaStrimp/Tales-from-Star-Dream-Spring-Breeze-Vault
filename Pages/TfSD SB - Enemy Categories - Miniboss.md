## Miniboss Enemies
![[TfSD SB - Images - Enemy Categories - Miniboss.png]]
The tougher type of enemies.

Minibosses lock the camera and change the [[TfSD SB - UI - HUD|HUD]] to show their health rather than the score when they appear. Unlike regular enemies, they don't die in one hit and have more advanced movesets.

When their health reaches zero, the Minibosses leave their body behind. The player can either inhale or destroy the body, causing the camera and the [[TfSD SB - UI - HUD|HUD]] to return back to normal.
