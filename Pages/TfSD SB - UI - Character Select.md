## Character Select
![[TfSD SB - Image - UI - Character Select.png]]
A menu where the player can choose a character and skin before starting a stage. On the screen, we see the list of all available characters doing a little dance, and a spotlight pointed at the currently selected character.

Pressing Left/Right keys scrolls through the characters while pressing Up/Down keys scrolls through the character skins. This may not work depending on the player's unlocks.

Pressing the 'A' key or the 'Start' key moves the player forward, and pressing the 'B' key moves the player back to the previous room.
