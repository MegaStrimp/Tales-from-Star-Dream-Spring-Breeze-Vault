## Button Remap
A menu where the player can remap their keyboard input and change controller control type.

Pressing the 'up'/'down' keys scrolls through the available options, and pressing the 'A'/'Start' keys selects the chosen option. While an option is selected, the player can press any button in their keyboard to map their chosen keyboard key to the selected in-game control.

Additionally, there's an extra option that changes the layout type for the player's controller to 'Type A' or 'Type B'. The 'Type A' option maps the 'A' key to 'face buttons 2 & 3' and the 'B' key to 'face buttons 1 & 4', while the 'Type B' option maps the 'A' key to 'face buttons 1 & 4' and the 'B' key to 'face buttons 2 & 3'.

Pressing the 'B' key while no options are selected moves the player back to [[TfSD SB - UI - Config Mode|Config Mode]].
