## Lololo & Lalala Controller
[[TfSD SB - Enemy Categories - Boss|Enemy Category - Boss]]
**HP -** 6
**Points -** 6500

Lololo & Lalala appear from one of the four doors at each side of the boss room, pushing boxes, which are worth 400 points, across one of the four ledges and disappearing into the door at the opposite side. To defeat them, Kirby must inhale their boxes and spit them back. Each of the two can be defeated separately. If one is defeated while pushing a box, the box will still move as if the boss was still there.  
The duo walks faster in the Extra Game.
