![[TfSD SB - Image - UI - Pause Screen.png]]
A screen that appears when the player pauses the game by pressing the 'Start' button. The game enters a frozen state and two prompts appear on the screen, alongside a text saying "Paused". The two prompts are 'Continue' and 'End'. The player can choose a prompt by scrolling with 'Up'/'Down' buttons.

Pressing the 'A' button while the 'Continue' prompt is selected, alongside pressing the 'B' button or the 'Start' button, will unpause the game and make the Pause Screen disappear; and pressing the 'A' button while the 'End' prompt is selected, leads the player back to the [[TfSD SB - UI - Main Menu|Main Menu]].
