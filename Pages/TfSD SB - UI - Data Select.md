A menu where the player can select one of three save files before they start playing.

The player can scroll through available save files with the Left/Right keys, and press Up/Down keys to select the option to delete a save. Once the 'deletion state' is active, the player can select any save file to delete it by pressing the 'A' key, which then the state reverts back to normal. Pressing the 'B' key during the 'deletion state' also reverts it back.

Pressing the 'A' key or the 'Start' key while a save data is selected, moves the player to the [[TfSD SB - UI - Main Menu|Main Menu]] with their selected save file; and pressing the 'B' key moves the player back to the [[TfSD SB - UI - Title Screen|Title Screen]].
