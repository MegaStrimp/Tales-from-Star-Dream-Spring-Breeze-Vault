**HP -** 10

As the game's final boss, King Dedede possesses a wider range of attacks than the bosses fought prior to him. He may attempt to pounce on the player, hit him with his hammer or inhale him, spitting him out again to cause damage. He is also able to jump into the air, harming the player if he lands on him. Both his jumping and hammer attacks generate stars, which the player has to use as ammunition to defeat him. When the player is above him, Dedede is furthermore able to jump straight into the air and swing his hammer; this attack does not make any stars appear.  
In the Extra Game, he moves faster, as well as jumping further and more often.
